Testing methods:
* The server was compiled and run throughout the development process. We utilized curl requests and Postman to test functionality.
* Many fprintf statements were used to track the program's progress and debug various issues
* Returns of curl requests with and without the "-i" term helped understand program output
* Utilized standalone methods of implementing parser to ensure that provided parser code would work on realistic requests. Some modifications to parser were required.
* The autograder scripts were run to ensure our program would pass with the expected outputs. This also helped ensure proper error handling.


Vulnerabilities:
* No logging of data on a backend
* No security measures implemented
* Only serves static files within www folder
* Cannot service more than 1020 (1024 - 4 standard) connections
* Source code is open source
